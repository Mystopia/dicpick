DICPick
=======

DICPick is a service that helps to allocate tasks to people during an event.  It accepts point values for different
kinds of task, and takes availability and other constraints into account in finding a fair allocation of work.

It was created by [Mystopia](https://mystopia.camp/) to help allocate camp chores to campers during Burning Man.
In Mystopia parlance such chores are called DICs (Daily Individual Contributions), hence the name DICPick.


Using DICPick
-------------

You shouldn't need to run your own instance of DICPick.  
Mystopia plans to maintain a running service that any camp can use, as a year-round gift to the Burning Man community. 

Please email [mystopia@gmail.com](mailto:mystopia@gmail.com) for details.
